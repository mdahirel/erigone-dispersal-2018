 data as of 2021-05-07

- main data entry done: all NAs are true NAs, not "to be entered data"
- IMPORTANT note about dates: with the exception of `date_mating`, all dates are dates at which the phenomenon was **observed**, not dates at which it happened. Important to account for weekends and French public holidays (except August 15 when I worked) to calculate life periods durations, and to use survival models with interval censoring, or use times at rougher time scales (week?)
- environmental data (GIS layers): to be cleaned and included in repo? to be decided
